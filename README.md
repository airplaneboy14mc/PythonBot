# PythonBot
Currently in alpha but will help you moderate your server, it is a discord bot built off of Python
There are some dependencies such as discord.py, pip to import discord.py, python version 3.6 or newer.
Recommendations are that you use either Visual Code Studio, or IDLE to edit this. 
Can be run using these commands
Linux:
  python3 bot.py
Mac:
  python3 bot.py (I am not sure about the command but if this command fails use the one for Windows and try that, also check that you have the required packages above installed)
Windows:
  py bot.py
